## 🎯 Key Documentation Insights

### Platform Comparison Key Takeaways

**Cost Over 5 Years:**
```
WordPress:   $29,700 - $67,000 (ongoing support nightmare)
Our Next.js: $14,850 - $37,050 (predictable, scalable)
Webflow:     $6,510 - $54,100 (trapped in platform)
```

**For Healthcare (HIPAA Required):**
```
WordPress:   ⚠️ Possible but requires expert setup
Our Next.js: ✅ Built for compliance out of box
Webflow:     ❌ Not suitable for healthcare
```

**Scalability (Multi-Location Growth):**
```
WordPress:   Would need rearchitecture at scale
Our Next.js: Scales automatically, no migration
Webflow:     Hits ceiling, can't grow beyond platform
```

**Integration Capability:**
```
WordPress:   Plugin dependency (fragile, conflicts)
Our Next.js: Direct API access (clean, reliable)
Webflow:     Zapier workarounds (slow, unreliable)
```
